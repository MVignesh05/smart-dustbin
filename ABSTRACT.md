# Abstract

This project introduces an autonomous **Smart Garbage Separation System** designed to automate waste segregation at the source using **Internet of Things (IoT)** and **Artificial Intelligence**. Utilizing an **ESP32-CAM** as the primary vision node, the system captures waste imagery which is analyzed by a high-performance **Object Detection Model (YOLO)**. The model accurately classifies items into Medical, Plastic, or General waste, subsequently automating servo-actuated lids for contactless disposal.

The system is coupled with a Flask-based **Analytics Dashboard** that monitors real-time detection data and operational status. By transforming reactive waste disposal into a proactive, data-driven process, the system identifies peak usage trends and facilitates predictive maintenance. Furthermore, the platform utilizes collected data to provide **intelligence-driven suggestions for waste reduction**, analyzing high-volume categories to recommend specific strategies for minimizing their generation. This solution significantly enhances waste management efficiency, minimizes human error, and provides a scalable architecture suitable for deployment in modern smart city infrastructure.
